IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences otuPS51 and otuPS52 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences otuPS8 and otuPS9 are exactly identical


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences otuPS149 and otuPS150 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 3 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 9 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file /branchinecta/shared/physcraperex/data/ilex-test-local/run_T1281-M2478/physcraper_T1281-M2478.fas.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 9 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 656 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 29.38%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 user-specified trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units

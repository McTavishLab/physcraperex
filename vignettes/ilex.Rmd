## I. Finding a tree to update

### With the Open Tree of Life website

Go to the [Open Tree of Life website](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/opentree12.3@ott93302) and use the "search for taxon" menu to look up the taxon *Ilex*.

This is how the genus *Ilex* is represented on the Open Tree of Life synthetic tree at the middle of year 2020:

```{r ilex-tree-opentree, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Go to the website and look at it [here](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/ottol@727571/Ilex)", out.width = '100%', fig.retina= 2}
# library(webshot)
# webshot("https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/ottol@727571/Ilex", "ilex-tree-opentree.png")

# webshot did not work on opentree website
knitr::include_graphics("ilex-tree-opentree-2020-05-31.png")
```

***

Navigating into the tree, we notice that there might be two studies associated to this portion of the Open Tree synthetic tree.

```{r ilex-tree-opentree-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%', fig.retina= 2}

knitr::include_graphics("ilex-tree-opentree-2020-05-31-2.png")
```

***

Let's verify that on the [study curator of OToL](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator).

Studies matching the word 'ilex' on the curator database, at the middle of year 2020. Some of these studies are not actually about the hollies, but other taxa that have the species epithet *ilex*.

```{r ilex-curation-opentree, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%', fig.retina= 2}
knitr::include_graphics("ilex-curation-opentree-2020-05-31.png")
```

### Finding a tree to update using the R package rotl

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- ilex <- rotl::tnrs_match_names(names = "ilex") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::kable(ilex, caption = "Taxonomic Name Resolution information for the genus *Ilex*") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Can we use the *OTT id* to get some trees or studies? -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- rotl::studies_properties() -->
<!-- ``` -->

Explain what a focal clade is.

There is a handy function that will search a taxon among the focal clades reported across trees.

```{r}
ilex <- rotl::studies_find_studies(property="ot:focalCladeOTTTaxonName", value="Ilex")
```

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(ilex, caption = "Studies with the genus *Ilex* as focal clade.")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
study2003 <-  ilex$study_doi %in% "http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.92.2.352"
```

It seems like the oldest tree, *`r ilex$candidate[study2003]`* from study *`r ilex$study_ids[study2003]`*, is in the Open Tree of Life synthetic tree.

Let's get it and plot it here:

```{r,include=FALSE}
par(mar=c(0,1,0,0), xpd=NA)  # adjust margins for all plots after this
```
```{r ilex-pg_2827-tree6577, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE, dpi = 300, fig.retina = 3, fig.width = 2, out.width="100%"}
ilex2003 <- rotl::get_study_tree(study_id = "pg_2827", tree_id = "tree6577")
ape::plot.phylo(ape::ladderize(ilex2003), type = "phylogram", cex = 0.3, label.offset = 1, edge.width = 0.5) 
```

*** 

Now, let's look at some properties of the tree:

```{r}
ape::Ntip(ilex2003)  # gets the number of tips
ape::is.rooted(ilex2003)  # check that it is rooted
ape::is.binary(ilex2003)  # check that it is fully resolved
datelife::phylo_has_brlen(ilex2003)  # checks that it has branch lengths
```
The tree has `r ape::Ntip(ilex2003)` tips, is rooted, has no branch lengths and is not fully resolved, as you probably already noted. Also, labels correspond to the labels reported on the original study [here](`r ilex$study_doi[study2003]`). Other labels are available to use as tip labels. For example, you can plot the tree using other labels, like the unified taxonomic names, or the taxonomic ids.


## II. Getting the underlying alignment

### TreeBASE

#### Using physcraper and the arguments `-tb` and `-no_est`

```
physcraper_run.py -s pg_2827 -t tree6577 -tb -no_est -o data/pg_2827_tree6577
```

#### Downloading the alignment directly from a repository

The alignments are here <https://treebase.org/treebase-web/search/study/matrices.html?id=1091>

On a mac you can do:
```
wget "http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/matrix/TB2:M2478?format=nexus" -o data-raw/alignments/T1281-M2478.nex
```


### Other repos


## III. Starting a physcraper a run


```
physcraper_run.py -s pg_2827 -t tree6577 -o data/pg_2827_tree6577
```

```
physcraper_run.py -s pg_2827 -t tree6577 -a data-raw/alignments/T1281-M2478.nex -as nexus -o data/ilex
```

### Using a local BLAST database

```
physcraper_run.py -s pg_2827 -t tree6577 -a data-raw//alignments/T1281-M2478.nex -as nexus -db /Volumes/ADATA\ HV620/local_blast_db -o data/ilex
```

## IV. Reading physcraper results

### The physcraper tag

### Input files

Physcraper rewrites input files for a couple reasons: reproducibility, taxon name matching, and taxon reconciliation.
It writes the config file down if none was provided

### Run files

Files in here are also automatically written down by physcraper.

blast runs, alignments, raxml trees, bootstrap

The trees are reconstructed using RAxML, with tip labels corresponding to local ids (e.g., otu42009, otuPS1) and not taxon names (e.g., *Helwingia japonica*), nor taxonomic ids (e.g., ott or ncbi). Branch lengths are proportional to relative substitution rates.
The RAxML tree with taxon names as tip labels is saved on the `outputs_tag` folder.

```{r,include=FALSE}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1), xpd=NA)  # adjust margins for all plots after this
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width='100%', fig.retina=3, dpi=300, out.extra='style="background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: inline-block;"'}
ilex_new_tree <- ape::read.tree(file = "../data/pg_2827_tree6577/run_T1281-M2478/RAxML_bestTree.2020-06-02")
ape::plot.phylo(ape::ladderize(ilex_new_tree), type = "fan", cex = 0.25, label.offset = 0.02, edge.width = 0.5)
```

### Output files

A number of files is automatically written down by physcraper.

A nexson tree with all types of tip labels is saved in here.
From this tree, a tree with any kind of label can be produced.
By default, the updtaed tree with taxon names as tip labels is saved 
in the `output_tag` folder as `updated_taxonname.tre`.


```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width='100%', fig.height= 15, fig.retina=3, dpi=300}
ilex_new_tree_labeled <- ape::read.tree(file = "../data/pg_2827_tree6577/outputs_T1281-M2478/updated_taxonname.tre")
# ape::plot.phylo(ape::ladderize(ilex_new_tree_labeled), cex = 0.35)
```
```{r,include=FALSE}
par(mar=c(1.8,1.7,1.5,1.7), xpd=NA)  # adjust margins for all plots after this
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, out.width='100%', fig.retina=3, dpi=300,  out.extra='style="background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: inline-block;"'}
ape::plot.phylo(ape::ladderize(ilex_new_tree_labeled), type = "fan", cex = 0.2, label.offset = 0.02, edge.width = 0.5)
```
